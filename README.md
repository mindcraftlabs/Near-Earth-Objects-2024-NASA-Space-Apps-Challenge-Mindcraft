Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical counterparts.

    <h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, 
        such models have been referred to as orreries. Today, we have numerous tools to develop virtual models of 
        celestial bodies. Determining the orbits of celestial bodies is essential, using Keplerian parameters 
        such as eccentricity, semi-major axis, inclination, and more.
    </p>
    <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
    <p>
        Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that displays celestial bodies, including 
        planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA), Near-Earth Comets (NEC), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHA).
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider creating an educational tool or a game to explore the solar system. Your orrery can be static 
        or dynamic, and must be interactive.
    </p>
    <h2>💡 Potential Considerations</h2>
    <h3>🛠 Skill Levels</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginner:</strong> Create a basic static orrery.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Develop a static orrery with more features.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Implement a dynamic orrery using an orbital propagator.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>📚 Resources</h3>
    <p>
        Utilize NASA datasets, free open-source 3D graphics libraries, and more. 
        The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA website</a> is a great starting point for available data.
    </p>
    <h2>🌟 Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>🪐 Labels for celestial bodies</li>
        <li>🌈 Colored orbital trajectories</li>
        <li>⚙️ User controls for toggling labels and trajectories</li>
        <li>⏩ Speed control for dynamic orreries</li>
        <li>📂 Custom data uploads for orbital parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📦 Submission</h2>
    <p>
        Provide a link to the deployed web page with the interactive orrery. Ensure your app works across multiple 
        browsers and cite all sources for libraries, data sets, and tutorials.
    </p>
    <h2>🚀 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Embrace this opportunity to create an engaging and educational tool that showcases the wonders of our 
        solar system. Good luck with your project! 🌠
